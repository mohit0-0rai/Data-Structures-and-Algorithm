Explanation

After 14s, first child will eat 14/2 i.e., 7 chocolates, second child will eat 14/6 i.e., 2 chocolates and third child will eat 14/14 i.e., 1 chocolate. So,
total chocolates will be 10.

Note: Your code should be able to convert the sample input into the sample output. However, this is not enough to pass the challenge, because the code will be run

on multiple test cases. Therefore, your code must solve this problem statement. Hie.
